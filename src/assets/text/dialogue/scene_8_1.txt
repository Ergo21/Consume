Anubis (ANUBIS)= "Who are you to disturb the realm of the dead?"
PLAYER (PLAYER)= "Who are you that can raise the dead?"
Anubis (ANUBIS)= "I am Anubis, the protector of these tombs and I did not raise them. They attacked you for your intrusion. An answer for an answer."
PLAYER (PLAYER)= "I am PLAYER, and I seek to learn how to raise and control the dead."
Anubis (ANUBIS)= "While it is true I can teach you to prepare a body so that they have a semblance of life after death I cannot teach you to control them. I am the protector not a jailer. I should warn you though the training will take years of dedication, and is not to be undertaken lightly."
PLAYER (PLAYER)= "I don’t have that kind of time."
Anubis (ANUBIS)= "Then I cannot help you. You may leave, as you have not stolen from the dead."
PLAYER (PLAYER)= "I’m not leaving without your power."
Anubis (ANUBIS)= "I told you I cannot…"
PLAYER (PLAYER)= "I wasn’t asking."
